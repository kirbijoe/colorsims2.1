# colorsims2.1

An amended version of ColorSims 2.0 (https://github.com/kirbijoe/colorsims2) which allows for the initialization of agent naming systems with unnamed space. Simulations can be executed from demo.py. The module get_results.py includes functions that can be used for post-simulation analysis. This package is compatible with Python3.
